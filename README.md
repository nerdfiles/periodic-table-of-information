# Periodic Table of Information

The Periodic Table of Information is a Dual-Aspect Spinozistic Interpretation
of Cyberspace such that the Web of Trust and Chain of Trust are unified.
Ideally our system should describe the necessary and sufficient conditions
for behavior of all fields and configurations as they pertain to transmedia
identity rules and hypermedia identity requirements.

Technologically PTI is "structural" specification expressed as a Formal Input
Language which might support explication, aggregation, organization,
integration, synthesis, resolution, unification of information as defined
through its transaction artifact mass, mathematically formalized as an
orthonormal periodic projectivization of Abelian homomorphic groups binding
amplification symmetries between cyberspaces.

Ultimately PTI will be a specification for potentially server-less, domain-less, <a href="https://serialseb.com/speaker/versions-are-evil/">version-less</a> cyberspaces. Core concepts derived from <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7774388">Model of Everything</a>.

## Information Basics

For [cyberspaces][schedgmule], minimal and maximal procedures of truth given the discernment
and classification of data, such that it is necessarily and sufficiently
distinguished from information. That said, information is defined by the
following metastructural specification for infocologically-sane cyberspaces.

### Deflationary Orders of Trust

[Information][ccp], i, is

    timeless        factivity order
    versionless     motive order
    serverless      byzantine order
    permissionless  incept assertion order
    tokenless       assertion order
    keyless         closure order
    trustless       anti-luck order
    domainless      achievement order
    passwordless    ability order
    modeless        non-local order (non-deref)

S is informed that i if and only if i meets the framework of
criteria outlined above. Therefore, S ascertains that p when and only when
p is entailed by i, where such epistemic determinations are possible
for any agent, S, to which the relevant orders are appropriate.

Any agent has spontaneous or autonomous knowledge. Autonomous knowledge
of i occurs when and only when no order is satisfied; whereas spontaneous
knowledge is determined by a veridical status of all orders. An example is
the distinction between speaking and making noise; — knowing that A is
speaking constitutes an informative fact such that the proposition given is
timeless (known at-present), versionless (known purposefully), etc. So then
replacing the predicate "is true" becomes a practice such that a fact's
ontological status is not designated by correspondence but by coherence
to the given orders, as timeless, versionless, serverless, etc. insofar
as some proposition as a veridical statement is consistent with its
indiscernible situation. We might say that the orders are the description
of the process of errancy with respect to any undecidable statement of
the situation within cyberspace. Therefore, events in cyberspace are
timeless, versionless, serverless, permissionless, tokenless, keyless,
trustless, domainless, passwordless, and modeless.

A cyberspace of information exchanges would be maximally egalitarian if
all information exchanges are constructivistically enforced through
the aforementioned protocols. Properties of a maximally egalitarian
information network confers certain properties such as censorship-resistence,
antifragility, decentralization, reality (this-ness), supervenience,
trans-world identity, certainty, etc.

A digression might be in order. When one interacts with a coin or a paperclip
serendipitously along a sidewalk, interaction with this item can be said to
be meaningful or non-meaningful, but only if that interaction can be said to
be purposeful or non-purposeful. For information reference architectures the
genericity of these procedures of truth cohere with the non-reducible
categories of discernment and classification. Maximally ascertained, an
event in either the celestial spheres or in cyberspaces can be said to be
meaningful; maximally classified, an event in either the spheres or spaces
can be said to be purposeful. With these distinctions we formalize the basis
of distinguishing holonomic and non-holonomic descriptions of spacetime,
which can be said to be localized, localizable, etc. to timezones à la A.
Braxton.

If one were to pick up a coin, an intentional stance taken toward the given
is recognized as fundamentally different from an action involving a musical
instrument. The local configuration of subject to patient is conceivable
within the procedures of truth available to the multiple realizability of
the situation, ceteris paribus, conformant to a boolean satisfiable matrix
reduction over the categories of information. Such a metastructure defines
the convergent norm of reality of the attributes of cyberspace for all
periodically homonomic phenomena, enervating timelessly yet amplifying the
contours of maximalized uniform gesture.

### Information Life

Beliefs and aliefs are cast along the dimensions of information life such that praxiological norms are verified by the assessment of linguistic constructs evidenced in the events of contextualized, localized, relevantized narratological discourse. Truth are designed within a consistent presentation and representation of procedures of truth.

## Layers

The fact that there are 5 layers is not coincidental. We have the following
layers:

    Context
    Narration
    Discovery
    Value
    Attribution
